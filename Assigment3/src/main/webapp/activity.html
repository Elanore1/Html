    <br /><br /><a class="Text"> The Alarme Game</a>
    <p>
        <br />1- A player determines a time slot that will arrive in a short time.<br />For example, if it is 10:23 pm, he will say "between 10:30 and 11 pm".
        <br /><br />2-All players set an alarm on their phone in this time slot without showing it to others.<br /><br />3- The goal of the game is not to make the alarm ring first or last.<br /><br />The first and the last will drink 3 sips (or a token for the little ones)<br /><br /><br />

        <br /><a class="Text"> The President</a><br />
        <p3>
            <br />Players: 4-6<br />Material: a deck of 52 cards.<br /><br />All the cards are dealt and the one who has the queen of hearts starts.<br />It is played clockwise. The goal of the game is to have no more cards in your hand.
            <br />The cards are ranked as follows:<br />| 2 | Ace | King | Queen | Jack | 10 | 9 | ... | 3 | with 2 being the best card and 3 the lowest.<br /><br /><br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;If Player 1 lays down a single card, Player 2 (and subsequent players) must lay down a higher card (regardless of suit).<br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;If Player 1 lays down a pair, Player 2 (and subsequent players) must also play with two cards that have the same number but are still higher than</br>&emsp;&emsp;the previous cards. The same rule applies for three and four cards of the same number.<br /><br /><br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;In the President there are ranks:<br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;- The president who is the winner of the previous game.<br />&emsp;&emsp;- The vice president or minister is the one who came second.<br />&emsp;&emsp;- The vice asshole who is the second last.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;- The asshole who is the loser of the previous game.<br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;-> The president will give his two least advantageous cards to the asshole, and the asshole will give his two best cards to the president for the next<br />&emsp;&emsp;game.<br />&emsp;&emsp;-> The vice president will give a less advantageous card to the vice asshole who in turn will give him his best card for the next game.<br />

    <p class="text">
        <br /><br />A classic of evenings with friends or family, the post-it game is simple.<br /><br />You have to write on a post-it the name of a character, and stick it on the forehead of your right neighbor.<br />The goal is to guess the name of the personality.<br />The youngest player starts by asking a question.<br />If the player gets a "yes" answer, he or she can continue with another question.<br />If the answer is "no", it is the right-hand neighbor's turn to ask a question... until the table is full.<br />Between 3 and 8 players are needed for this game.
